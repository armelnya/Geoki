AI and Robotics in Geo- and Environnement Modeling.
This is the python implementation(Tensorflow) of the deep learning model for reconstruction surpervised approach
# Experiment Results
With the goal of reconstruct the image 2D of the structure of the velocity from recorded data.
Our method contains two stages: the reconstruction image from record data and the prediction process.We can see the result file.
# Setup
# Prerequisite
1.Python/extension compiler latest version
2.Tensorflow:gpu python3:6
3.Import necessary Libraries
4.We have to install the Modul (Radon Transform): which is a python library capable of helping us to reconstruct real image from raw data.
